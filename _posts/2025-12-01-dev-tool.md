I'm excited to announce the release of my first Visual Studio Code extension: **Developer Tools**! It's a collection of productivity utilities I've bundled together to streamline my daily development workflow.

You can find the source code on GitHub: [https://github.com/joealfa/developer-tools](https://github.com/joealfa/developer-tools)

## Why I Built This

As developers, we constantly perform repetitive tasks—generating unique identifiers, creating secure passwords, and leaving notes for ourselves or teammates about specific lines of code. I found myself repeatedly searching for online tools or switching contexts to accomplish these simple tasks.

I decided to bring these utilities directly into my editor, where I spend most of my development time. The result is Developer Tools—a lightweight extension that keeps me focused without leaving VS Code.

## Features

### UUID/GUID Generation

Need a unique identifier? With Developer Tools, you can insert UUIDs or GUIDs directly at your cursor position with a single command.

**Available formats:**
- **UUID** - Lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`)
- **GUID (Uppercase)** - Uppercase with hyphens
- **UUID Compact** - No hyphens for when you need a cleaner format
- **GUID Compact (Uppercase)** - Uppercase without hyphens

**Bonus:** Multi-cursor support! If you have multiple cursors active, each cursor receives its own unique identifier. You can also select text spanning multiple lines, and the extension will replace the selection with one UUID per line.

### Password Generator

An interactive panel for generating secure, customizable passwords without leaving your editor.

**Customization options:**
- Length from 5 to 128 characters
- Include/exclude uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Set minimum requirements for numbers and special characters
- Avoid ambiguous characters (like `0`, `O`, `I`, `l`, `1`)
- Copy to clipboard or insert directly into your document

### Code Notes

This is the feature I'm most proud of. Code Notes lets you attach persistent notes to specific lines in your code files. Think of it as leaving sticky notes in your codebase.

**Key features:**
- **Categories** - Organize notes as Note, TODO, FIXME, or Question with color-coded icons
- **Line tracking** - Notes automatically move when you insert or delete lines above them
- **Auto-show/hide panel** - The side panel appears when your cursor lands on a line with notes
- **Orphaned note detection** - Notes are marked as "orphaned" when their original line content changes significantly
- **File rename tracking** - Notes follow files when renamed or moved within the workspace
- **Bottom panel table** - View all notes across your project in a searchable, filterable table
- **Grouping** - Group notes by file, category, or status
- **Import/Export** - Export notes to JSON for backup or sharing

**Storage:**
Notes are stored in VS Code's workspace state by default. If storage reaches capacity, you'll be prompted to migrate to file-based storage (`.vscode/notes.json`), which supports larger datasets and can be version-controlled with your project.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

The extension comes with convenient default shortcuts:

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Add Note | `Ctrl+Alt+N` |
| Show Notes Panel | `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+N` |

All other commands are accessible via the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) by typing "Developer Tools".

## Technical Details

The extension is built with TypeScript and follows VS Code's extension API best practices. Some interesting technical aspects:

- **Singleton pattern** for the NotesService to ensure consistent state
- **Event-driven architecture** with proper disposal of listeners
- **Debounced saves** to prevent excessive disk writes
- **Fuzzy line matching** using surrounding context to relocate notes when code changes
- **Webview panels** for the password generator and notes interfaces

## What's Next?

I have several ideas for future improvements:

- Publish to the VS Code Marketplace
- Add more generator utilities (timestamps, lorem ipsum, etc.)
- Team collaboration features for notes
- Note templates and snippets
- Integration with GitHub Issues for TODO notes

## Try It Out

Clone the repository and give it a spin:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joealfa/developer-tools
cd developer-tools
npm install
```

Then press `F5` in VS Code to launch the extension in a new Extension Development Host window.

I'd love to hear your feedback! Feel free to open issues or contribute on GitHub. This is my first VS Code extension, and I learned a lot building it. Hopefully, it proves useful in your development workflow too!
