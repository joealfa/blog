I'm excited to share some improvements I've made to my Technical Interview Preparation tool! If you're looking to brush up on your coding interview skills, you can check it out here: [https://joealfa.github.io/reviewer](https://joealfa.github.io/reviewer)

## What's New?

I've spent some time refining and enhancing the original version of this tool to make it more useful for developers preparing for technical interviews. The improvements focus on both functionality and user experience.

## Why I Built This

Technical interview preparation can be overwhelming. There are so many topics to cover, questions to practice, and concepts to review. I wanted to create a tool that helps organize this process and makes it easier to track progress while studying.

## Features

The Technical Interview Preparation tool helps you:

- Review common technical interview questions
- Practice coding problems
- Track your preparation progress
- Access resources in an organized manner

## What's Next?

I'm continuously working on improving this tool based on my own interview preparation experiences. Future updates may include:

- More question categories
- Enhanced progress tracking
- Additional practice problems
- Better mobile responsiveness

## Try It Out

Feel free to check out the tool at [https://joealfa.github.io/reviewer](https://joealfa.github.io/reviewer) and let me know what you think! I'm always open to feedback and suggestions for improvement.

Whether you're actively interviewing or just keeping your skills sharp, I hope this tool proves helpful in your technical interview journey.
