Get ready for Azure-focused interviews with a condensed cheat sheet that blends fundamentals, architecture trade-offs, and whiteboard prompts.

## How To Use This Sheet
- Skim the **Core Service Matrix** before discussions to refresh positioning and value props.
- Review **Scenario Playbooks** for design questions and compare options quickly.
- Practice with the **Interview Drilldowns** to articulate why you would recommend a service.

## Core Service Matrix

| Service | What It Solves | Interview Angle |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Azure Virtual Machines | Lift-and-shift compute with full OS control | Compare VM scale sets vs. AKS vs. App Service |
| Azure App Service | Managed hosting for web/API workloads | Discuss PaaS benefits, scaling, deployment slots |
| Azure Functions | Event-driven serverless compute | Call out trigger types, cold starts, pricing |
| Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) | Managed Kubernetes orchestration | When to containerize vs. serverless; node pools |
| Azure SQL Database | Managed relational DB | Tier selection, HA/DR, hyperscale vs. elastic pools |
| Azure Cosmos DB | Globally distributed NoSQL | Consistency levels, partitioning, multi-region writes |
| Azure Blob Storage | Durable object storage | Hot/cool/archive tiers, static website hosting |
| Azure DevOps / GitHub Actions | CI/CD toolchain | Pipeline stages, environments, IaC integration |
| Azure Active Directory | Identity and access management | SSO, conditional access, B2B/B2C scenarios |

## Cloud Models At A Glance

| Model | Azure Example | Responsibility Split |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IaaS | Virtual Machines, Virtual Networks | Customer manages OS, runtime, data |
| PaaS | App Service, Azure SQL | Azure handles OS/patching; you handle code/data |
| SaaS | Microsoft 365, Dynamics | Azure handles everything; you configure |

## Key Advantages Of Cloud Adoption
- **Elastic scale**: Auto-scale sets, consumption-based serverless, bursting.
- **Cost optimization**: Reserved instances, spot VMs, Azure Advisor, pay-for-what-you-use.
- **Reliability & DR**: Availability zones, paired regions, site recovery.
- **Security & compliance**: Defender for Cloud, Azure Policy, identity governance.
- **Speed to market**: Templates (ARM/Bicep/Terraform), DevOps automation, marketplace solutions.

## Scenario Playbooks
### 1. Compute & App Hosting
- **When to choose App Service**: Stateless HTTP workloads, CI/CD integration, need slots.
- **When to choose AKS**: Microservices, container standardization, sidecars, custom networking.
- **When to choose Functions**: Spiky event-driven workloads, lightweight APIs, background jobs.
- **VM Scale Sets**: Legacy apps, custom images, migration stages.

### 2. Data & Storage
- **Relational**: Azure SQL (single/elastic/hyperscale) vs. SQL Managed Instance for near-100% compatibility.
- **NoSQL**: Cosmos DB for global scale, Table Storage for simple key/value.
- **Analytics**: Synapse, Data Lake Storage, Databricks for big data or AI workloads.
- **Binary assets**: Blob tiers (hot/cool/archive) + lifecycle policies, CDN acceleration.

### 3. Messaging & Integration
- **Service Bus**: Enterprise messaging, ordered delivery, dead-letter queues.
- **Storage Queue**: Lightweight messaging, cost-sensitive, no ordering.
- **Event Grid**: Reactive event routing (pub/sub) across Azure resources.
- **Event Hubs**: High-throughput streaming ingestion for telemetry/IoT.
- **SignalR Service**: Real-time websockets at scale (dashboards, chat, collaborative apps).

### 4. Identity, Governance & Security
- **Azure AD**: SSO, conditional access, identity protection, B2B/B2C flows.
- **RBAC vs. ABAC**: Assign least privilege with role assignments, use PIM for JIT elevation.
- **Resource groups**: Lifecycle grouping, delegated ownership, policy scope.
- **Policy & Blueprints**: Enforce guardrails, tag compliance, regulatory alignment.

## Azure Functions Deep Dive
- **Triggers to remember**: HTTP, Timer, Queue/Service Bus, Blob, Cosmos DB, Event Grid, Event Hub, SignalR.
- **Bindings**: Input/output connectors for storage, databases, and messaging without SDK boilerplate.
- **Performance talking points**: Warm vs. cold starts, premium plan, durable functions for orchestration, retries.
- **Typical interview scenario**: File upload triggers image resizing + message to queue for downstream processing.

## Storage & Networking Quick Reference

| Service | Use When | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Blob Storage | Unstructured data, data lake staging | Lifecycle policies, immutability, static websites |
| File Storage | Lift-and-shift SMB shares | Mount via SMB/NFS, AD integration |
| Queue Storage | Simple, cost-effective messaging | Best-effort ordering, 7-day message retention |
| Disk Storage | VM disks (OS/data) | Premium SSD for IOPS, Ultra Disk for latency |
| Azure Load Balancer | Layer 4 traffic | Internal vs. public, HA ports |
| Application Gateway | Layer 7, SSL offload, WAF | Path-based routing, rewrite headers |

## Azure SQL & Data Strategy
- **Benefits**: Automated patching/backups, geo-replication, built-in performance advisor, threat detection.
- **Trade-offs**: Edition tiers (Basic/Standard/Premium/Hyperscale), vCore vs. DTU, serverless compute tier to auto-pause.
- **Alternatives**: Managed Instance for SQL Agent/CLR, PostgreSQL/MySQL flexible server for open-source stacks.

## DevOps & Automation Essentials
- **Azure DevOps**: Boards, Repos, Pipelines, Test Plans, Artifacts.
- **GitHub Actions**: YAML workflows, reusable actions, environments.
- **Infrastructure-as-Code**: ARM/Bicep/Terraform, deployment slots, release gates.
- **Pipelines**: Build → test → security scan → release with approvals and integration tests.

## Common Interview Prompts & How To Respond
1. **Lift-and-shift vs. modernize**: Outline assessment → landing zone → choose VM vs. containers vs. App Service.
2. **Design a global e-commerce site**: Front Door/CDN, App Service or AKS, Geo-redundant database (Cosmos DB or Azure SQL geo-replication), Traffic Manager fallback.
3. **Build a serverless image processing workflow**: Blob trigger Function → Durable orchestrator → Storage queue → Cosmos DB metadata.
4. **Secure multi-tier app**: VNet integration, subnets, NSGs, Azure Firewall, Private Endpoints, Key Vault for secrets.
5. **Cost optimization conversation**: Advisor recommendations, reserved capacity, right-sizing, auto-shutdown for dev/test, tagging.

## Rapid-Fire Q&A
- **Difference between App Service vs. Functions?** Stateful vs. stateless HTTP, always-on requirements, pricing.
- **Service Bus vs. Storage Queue?** Advanced features (ordering, sessions, topics) vs. simplicity.
- **Blob vs. Files?** REST-based object store vs. SMB/NFS shares.
- **AKS vs. VM Scale Set?** Container orchestration with declarative deployments vs. traditional VM scaling.
- **Public vs. private load balancer?** Internet-facing vs. VNet-only workloads.
- **RBAC basics**: Assign roles (Owner/Contributor/Reader) at subscription/resource group/resource scope; pair with Azure AD groups.

## Whiteboard Exercises
- Sketch a multi-region active-active deployment with Front Door, App Gateway, and geo-replicated data store.
- Map out a CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions with staged environments and approvals.
- Draw a hub-and-spoke network with VPN/ExpressRoute, Azure Firewall, and private endpoints.
- Show how Azure Functions integrate with Event Grid and Cosmos DB for IoT telemetry.

## Study Tips
- Bookmark the Azure Architecture Center scenario library and Well-Architected Review checklist.
- Practice cost estimations with the Azure Pricing Calculator for common workloads.
- Keep a mental map of services grouped by category (compute, storage, integration, analytics, security).
- Rehearse STAR-format stories for migration, optimization, and incident response experiences.
