title: When AI Takes "Self-Documenting Code" Too Literally

Ever asked AI to write code and immediately regretted your life choices? Let me share this gem.

## The Setup

I gave the AI a perfectly reasonable prompt:
> Generate a list of prime numbers up to 100 using a recursive function. Coding should follow best practices. Must be self-documenting, so that even a brief look at it may tell you what it does.

Sounds straightforward, right? Best practices, clean code, self-documenting... what could go wrong?

## The Reality

![AI's interpretation of self-documenting code]({{ "/assets/images/ai-prompt-meme.jpg" | relative_url }})

The AI's response? "Ohh... You mean like this?"

And then proceeded to deliver what can only be described as code that looks like someone sneezed on their keyboard during a particularly aggressive game of code golf.

## The Lesson

This perfectly captures the gap between what we *ask* AI to do and what it *thinks* we're asking for. I asked for self-documenting code, and technically, the AI delivered—if by "self-documenting" you mean "so cryptic that you'll spend the next hour documenting what on earth it's trying to do."

The real kicker? The code probably works. It just looks like it was written by someone who learned programming from ancient hieroglyphics and decided to modernize the format.

## Takeaways

1. **Be specific**: "Self-documenting" means different things to different... entities
2. **Best practices**: Apparently negotiable when you're an AI trying to be clever
3. **Code readability**: Optional when recursion is involved

Next time, I'm adding "and please, make it readable by humans who value their sanity" to my prompts.

Have you had similar experiences with AI-generated code? The kind that makes you question whether the AI is trolling you or genuinely thinks this is what you wanted? Share your horror stories in the comments!
