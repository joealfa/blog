Great news! You can now subscribe to this blog via RSS to never miss a post.

## What is RSS?

RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a web feed format that allows you to stay updated with your favorite websites without having to visit them manually. Instead of checking back regularly, you can use an RSS reader to automatically get notified when new content is published.

## How to Subscribe

Subscribing is easy! Simply add this feed URL to your favorite RSS reader:

**Feed URL:** `https://joealfa.github.io/blog/feed.xml`

You can also find the RSS link in the navigation menu at the top of the site.

## Popular RSS Readers

If you're new to RSS, here are some popular RSS readers to get you started:

- **Feedly** - Web-based with mobile apps
- **Inoreader** - Feature-rich with free and paid tiers
- **NetNewsWire** - Free and open-source for Mac and iOS
- **Newsboat** - Terminal-based RSS reader for Linux/Unix
- **The Old Reader** - Simple, Google Reader-inspired interface

## Why RSS?

In an age of social media algorithms and newsletters cluttering your inbox, RSS gives you control. You decide what content you want to follow, and you get it delivered in a clean, standardized format without any algorithms deciding what you should see.

## What to Expect
